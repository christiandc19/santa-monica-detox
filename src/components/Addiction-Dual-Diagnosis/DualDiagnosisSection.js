        <h1>Helping You Find Balance and Renewed Wellness</h1>
        <p>At Santa Monica Detox, we understand the complex nature of co-occurring disorders, and we're dedicated to providing compassionate, integrated care to individuals seeking healing for both their mental health and substance use challenges.</p>

        <h1>Understanding Dual Diagnosis</h1>
        <p>Dual diagnosis, also known as co-occurring disorders, refers to the presence of both a substance use disorder (SUD) and a mental health disorder (such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, etc.) in an individual. These conditions often interact and exacerbate each other, making treatment more complex but also more crucial.</p>
